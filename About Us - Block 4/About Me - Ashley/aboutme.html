	<h2> <p style="color: white;"> All About Ashley 💁🏼</h2> </p>

	<h3> <p style="color: white;">Biography</h3> </p>
	<p style="color: #5222e3; background: black;">I am currently a senior at Academy for Careers in Television and Film.  In junior year, I took AP US History and Ap English Language. This year I am taking AP Calculus and AP Computer Science. My favorite subjects are math and science. In college, I would want to major in the STEM field and am thinking to choose computer science or a type of engineering. 💻 </p>

	<p style="color: black; background: #5222e3;">When I'm not in school, I like hanging out with my friends and my family ❤️. I also like listening to music 🎶 and watching tv shows with my family. My favorite place to go during the summer is the beach ☀️. The only pets that I have are turtles 🐢, and I have 4 of them. I currently live in Queens, New York and would want to travel to different countries when I'm older ✈️. I love the moon 🌙, stars 💫, and space 🎆. </p>

	<h3><p style="color: white;">Favorite Music Artists</h3> </p>
	<p style="color: black; background: #5222e3;">My favorite genre of music is rock ☠️, but I also like other genres. My favorite singers are Lana Del Rey 💋 and Taylor Swift 💘. I recently went to a Taylor Swift pop up shop in New York, where I got to take cool pictures and get nice merch. I hope one day I get to go to a Taylor and Lana concert. Both of their new albums just came out and I listen to them daily. My favorite band is twenty one pilots 💛 and their music always makes me happy 😊. I actually got to see them in concert on October 2018 in Madison Square Garden 😱. It was such a happy experience for me and I want to go to even more concerts in the future. Other bands I like include: Starset, Queen, & Scorpions! </p>

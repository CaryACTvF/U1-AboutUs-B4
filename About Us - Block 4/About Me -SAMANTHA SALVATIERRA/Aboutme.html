	<h4>Biography</h4>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! I am Samantha Salvatierra, a 16 year old senior at ACTVF. My birthday is October 14, 2002. I am half Filipino and half Bolivian. My hobbies are singing, dancing and writing songs. I am a middle child. I have an older sister and a younger brother. My older sister went to ACTVF as well. I actually was orignally accepted to a school for the arts for singing but because I am really introverted I decided to come here since my sister attended this school already. Being in this school had it's ups and downs but I'm glad that I am almost done with this journey. I have 4 really close friends named Alicia,Sydney,Karen and Nayeli.</p> 
	<p> During my free time I like to write songs, sing and dance. In the future I want to become either a doctor or a nurse because I like to help people. My dream school is NYU. When I get older I want to be able to travel the world with no worries at all. I have been a fan of music ever since I was a little girl. My favorite artist keep me motivated when times are ruff and I need a moment of time for myself.</p>

<h5>Technology</title>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a daily basis I use my phone and my iPad.I find that technology makes life easier. I have an iPhone XR, airpods a iPad mini 5.My favorite app that I use religiously is instagram. My favorite games are Stack Jump and Panda Pop. I use Safari and Ecosia. I mainly use Ecosia because by using it I can help donate/plant trees every 45 searches.</p>

	<P> One of my ultimate dreams is owning a house and having a cute dog. Any dog would suffice as long as I can call it my own. I had a dog when I was younger but I was to young to have memory of her. I want to be able to take my dog on walks and give it baths. I want to adopt a dog from a shelter.

	<h2> All About Tyana</h2>
	<h3>Personal Biography</h3>
	Hello, my name is Tyana, I was born in Montego Bay, Jamaica and moved to America at the age of eight.  I have two younger brothers by my father and a step sister.  My birthday is September 19, 2002, which was actually yesterday because I am writing this on September 20th, I am now seventeen!  I am a high school senior and in the future I aspire to be successful and happy with my future family and friends.  Oh yea, I also have a youtube channel so ima just leave that here...
	<h3>Professional Biography</h3>
	<p>I dont have a lt of job experience, but the jobs that I did have were jobs that I truly enjoyed that could help me in my future caree field.  During the summer of 2018 I interned at TvF with Next Step Pictures, during this job I made some new friends, sadly we no longer speak but they were good people.  This past summer (summer 2019) I interned at the Apollo theather and earned the job of the head carpenter, which turned out to be a lot of responsibility and work to handle but I still got through it and had a wonderful summer.  In the furture I see myself working in the film industry and  director, producer and screen writer and I am truly hopefully that it will come out to be true.  I hope to attend I university that has film as a major so that I could get more experience in the field, and schools that I am interested in that have this are, USC, Ithica, Berkeley, Mason and a few more that I can't remember at the moment.</p>

	<h3> Technology</h3>
	<p> The technology I use includes my cracked up iPhoneX, my Mac Book Pro, an iPad, an Alexa and I believe thats it.  My favorite search engine is google chrome.  My favorite apps are the apps that I use to keep in contact with my friends and entertain me so for example I like iMessage, snapchat, instagram and of course Youtube. </p>

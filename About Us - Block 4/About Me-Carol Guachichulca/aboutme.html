	<h1>About me!</h1>
	<h2>All About Carol</h2>
	<h3>Biography</h3>
	<p>I am a senior at Academy for Careers in Television and Film and expected to graduate in June 2020 as well as applying to college in a few months. I have had jobs for the past two summers which include working in a food bank being a service learner discussing environmental issues going on in the world. In school I am interested in math and am taking an AP calculus class which really interests me. As of now, I am still unsure of what I would want to study in college but hope to find my passion through the classes I take. </p>

	<p>I don't really have any hobbies, but I am working after school in a clothing store for babies called Carter's. I live with my older sister and parents and have a close relationship with each of them. I just watch shows and play 2048 on my phone most of the time.</p>

	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>I use my phone and my computer everyday to communicate with people and get my school assignments done. Both my AP classes use the system of the flipped classroom (which depend heavily on the computer) to watch lessons at home and to practice new skills learned in the classroom. I always use Google Chrome. </p>

	<h3>Types of shows I like </h3>
	<p>I love realistic fiction movies that are dramatic and are in the category of thriller. I also really really enjoy plot twists because of that moment that the movie gets you when you least expect it. Right now my top three favorite shows are Money Heist, Dexter, and Prison Break </p>

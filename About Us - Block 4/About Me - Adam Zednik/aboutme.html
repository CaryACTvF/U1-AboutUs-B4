	<h4>Work Experience</h4>
 	<p>BAI - Over the summer of 2019 I was a Bloomberg Arts Intern at the New York Hall Of Science where I worked for Explainer TV by making Youtube videos for the museum Mondays through Wednesdays. Thursdays and Fridays I got to travel around many different cultural institutions across New York with my fellow interns.</p>
	<h4>Proffessional Interests/University Majors</h4>
	<p>I really love film which is why I am curently studying it. I plan on continuing to study it in University.</p>
	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>On a daily basis I use my Samsung Galaxy Note 8. With the S Pen I write to friends and family. My favourite app is the camera app as I take photos and videos every second of my life. My favourite Game is Piano Tiles 2 because it tests my hand eye cordination. My favourite web browser is DuckDuckGo. Other than that, I check emails and go on Facebook once in a while.  </p>
	<h3>Youtube Projects</h3>
	<p>In 2015 my brother and I created a channel called BotanicalRage. We had no idea in what direction we wanted to take it in. So we started off creating gaming videos. In 8th grade I had the opertunity to create a video for a group project in Social Studies. I formed a group and got to work without any knowledge on essential film </p>

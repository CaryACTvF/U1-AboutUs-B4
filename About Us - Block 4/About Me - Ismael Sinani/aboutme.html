	<h3 style="color: white;">Biography</h3>
	<p style="color: white;">My name is Ismael, but people call me 
	<b> <i>Ish</i> </b>
	mainly because they can't pronounce my name or because that just got stuck with me so everyone calls me that. I go to school at 
	<b>Academy in Careers of Television and Film</b>. 
	The summer of Sophmore year I worked as a waiter in Bareburger by Vernon Blvd. The summer of Junior year I applied to work at the <span style="color: lightblue;" >US Open</span>. A couple of proffessions I am interseted in are: 
	<ul style="color: white;">
	<li>Accounting</li>
	<li>Computer Engineering</li>
	<li>Financing</li>
	</ul> </p>
	<p style="color: white;">Some of my hobbies are playing New York style of Handball and playing soccer. I listen to music so oftenly because it relaxes me when I feel stressed about certian things</p>

	<p style="color: white;"> When I was younger I was so into soccer although I wasn't very good at it. I still like the sport but I am not so passionate about it as I was when I was younger.</p>

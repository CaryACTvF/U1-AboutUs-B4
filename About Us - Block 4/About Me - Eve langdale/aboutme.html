<h3>Biography 🚼</h3>
<p>I attended JHS 185 Edward Bleeker Middle School. Shortly after I became a Student at ACTVF High School. During my junior year I was placed into the editing cohort and then I found out that i had a skill and newly found love for editing. In college i hope my intrest for editing develops more but what i really want to do with my life is to get into politics. In college i would like to double major in Political science and Law.  </p>

<p>Politics 🚺 has always been a big part of my life and is one of the many intrests/passions that I have. Another big passion that I have is music. I love to sing and dance but most of the time I sing. During the last year and a half, I have been a part of a chourus group. This group has provided me with the experience of getting to see more Broadway shows, and even getting the chance to work with them! </p>

<h3>Technology 📱</h3>

<p>Growing up in the age of Generation Z, I've been exposed to tech for almost my whole life. The first piece of technology that I owned was a blue, fat, and bumpy toy called a Boobah. This toy spun around and sang "Boobahhhh" constantly. It was weird but I loved it. My second piece of technology was a leap frog - kind of like an ipad. When I was around 7 I had my first phone and it was a blacberry. Then now, I own a phone, an ipad, and 2 DS's.</p>

<h3>My Favorite Artists 🎤</h3>

<p>I love all types of music. The only music genre I really don't listen to is country. I love R&B, Pop, Soul, Rock, Emo, and Punk. Some of my favorite artists are Rico Nasty, Lizzo, Doja Cat, Nicki Minaj, Lauren Hill, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Lil Keyu, Megan Thee Stallion, Leikeli47, Jaden Smith, Willow Smith, TLC, Whitney Houston, Summer Walker, Drake, Kehlani, Lil Wayne, Cardi B, Lana Del Ray, Amy Winehouse, The Spice Girls and The Weekend.</p>

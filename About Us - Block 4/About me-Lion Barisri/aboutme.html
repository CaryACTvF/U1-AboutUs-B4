	<p style="color: red">School: ACTVF </p>
	<p style="color: red">Possible College Major: Business</p>

	<h3 style="color: red">Technology</h3> <h1>💻</h1>
	<p style="color: red">The technology I use on a daily includes a desktop, ps4, my phone, laptop. My favorite game is called the Witcher 3 and I personally think that it's the best game ever. My favorite browser to use is Chrome, since it's the easiest to use.</p>

	<h3 style="color: red">Things I want to do</h3>
	<p style="color: red">I want to learn the basics of how to make things move inside of game, and I to make random AIs in a game, which are able to move randomly on their own. The reason I wanna learn those things is to make my own game inside of Unity, which isn't as difficult as I thought, since you can start up with things that others had uploaded.</p>

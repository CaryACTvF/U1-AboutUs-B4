<h3>Biography</h3>

	<p> Hello! I am Nayeli, I am 17 years old, I am currently a student of the school ACTVF. At the moment I am a senior which is kinda fun because is my last year in this school then I go to college, but is kinda sad too. well let me tell you about my high school experience, I am a student of Actvf since 2016, i came here when i was 14 years old, my fresman year was kinda hard for me since my english wasnt that good, because my fisrt language is spanish, well i learned english in 6 month but still i didnt feel good talking because I thought my english wasn't that good and I was kinda shy to talk to people too. my junior year i transfered to another school here in new york, in which school I got more confident of myself and I started talking in english more with my friends, but for some other reasons my mom didn't like the school which make her transfer me again back to ACTVF. My junior year was more easier my GPA increased a lot, I even got a scholarship which i didnt accepted because if was outside the state and my parents didn't want me to go far away from home, ad here i am in senior year my last yera in this school, still working hard and searching up for college. </p>

	<p> During my free time i really like to be with my family or by myself, I like to have fun I like to do new thing, i am an adventure girl. I also like to listen yo music and dance even though i'm not good at it. about my family, my family is really small, i live with my mom and my dad, i am the only child, which is kinda cool because i get all the love of my parents but sometimes it is not because my parents are so over protective. which is not cool since im not allow to do a lot of things or go out lot. </p> 

	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>the technology that i use everyday is my phone to be in contact with my family and friends and my computer to do my homework. The computer that i use is MacBook PRO and the phone that i use is an iphone xs max. i really like to use safari and google. My favorite apps are instagram, snapchat and spotify. i dont really have a favorite one but i the moment i like to play Woody and Lep's World</p>
	<h3> My Dreams</h3>
	<p>sometimes i am really scared to talk about my dreams because i think if i said somethung that i have in mind is not gonnna come true or i dont want to think about it and just work hard to make my dream come true. i dont really trust people with this kind of things, because how about you never make that dream come true, everyone is just goign to look at you like haha you did do it, that why i keep it to myself until i have that dream comes true. one thing that i can said about my dreams is that i really want to better myself a be someone in life.</p>

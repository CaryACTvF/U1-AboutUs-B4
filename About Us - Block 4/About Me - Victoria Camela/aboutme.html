	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>All About Victoria</h2>
	<h3>Biography üåü</h3>
	<p style="color: red;">I am currently a senior at Academy for Carerrs in Television and Film, who is expected to graduate in Spring of 2020. I am currently enrolled in AP Calculus and AP Computer Science, which combines my interests of both computers and mathematics.  I have a small job which involves me babysitting my nephews and nieces. Every Year I also help my church assist kids who are attending Faith Formation Classes, I also help assit the teacher by handing out worksheets and collecting attendance. Although my school focuses on production, I would potentially like to major in Criminal Justice.</p>

	<p style="color: red;">My full name is Victoria Camela-Castelan and I was born on December 20, 2002. I am currently 16 years old. My family consists of my mom, my dad, my two older sisters, my two younger sibilings, my nephew, and my dog whose name is Toby. I don't really have hobbies but I usually watch movies on Netflix, I also really enjoy listening to music and watching videos on youtube.  </p>

	<h3>Technology üì≤</h3>
	<p style="color: purple;">On a daily basis I use the computer in order to complete edpuzzles for AP Calculus.My favorite search engine is YouTube because it contains millions of videos of different topics and music of different genres which keeps me entertained all the time.I have an iphone 8, and my favorite game on my phone is Balls because I can't seem to beat my sister's highscore of 181 which challenges me and intrigues me even in the game. The web browser use is Google Chrome.</p>

	<h3>My Pet Toby üê©</h3>
	<p style="color: blue;"> Toby is my dog whose breed is a puddle he is currently 7 years old, I got him back in 2012, when he was 4 months old. He was born on July 1st, 2012. It took him a while to get comfortable in his new home, but once he got used to it he started running all over. I enjoy taking him on walks and spending time with him by playing catch especially when it's sunny out. Although he is getting old he still acts like a puppy. </p>
